          We sorted our ideas into five clusters: one for specifics on the problem, one for basic requirements of a potential solution app,
          one for how to fund the app, one for must-have features, and a final one for nice-to-have features.

          From the home screen, you can go to your calendar, where you can see a daily, weekly, or monthly layout. 
          From there, you can add a new item in a specific time; if you attempt to double book yourself, you will receive an alert. 
          You can also find options for certain amounts of time; for example, if you need 2 hours to study biology, 
          you can search for 2 hour chunks within a certain period. You can choose to go to the events section, 
          where you can see a list of events based on how soon they are occuring and how close they are to the user. 
          You can then select events and view them in a calendar alongside you schedule. Then you can click on the event you want and
          either share it with others or RSVP to it. Outside of the app, there are 2 different notification banners, one for a reminder before an event, 
          and another for events you might be interested in. Before getting to the home screen, there is a splash screen where you can either register for 
          an account or log in to your already existing account. From multiple other places, you can reach the support page where you enter your email and
          the problem you need help with. Shows features for completing tasks, messages of encouragement, and task completion streak.
